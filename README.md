# QuickTools
tools that can be run from a single file and are location independent 

---------

## GitCloneClipboard.bat
- quickly clone a github repo anywhere on your computer
- place this bat file in the folder you want the repo and run it, that simple
- as the repo is cloned a new folder will be created matching the repos name
- it will also keep the link information incase you want to push your changes back to the repo or pull new changes; an easy way to do so is with VS Code

## Check NVidia install.bat
- great if you need to quickly confirm your GPU info
- current GPU driver; current CUDA version; GPU type
- power usage/cap; memory usage/total
